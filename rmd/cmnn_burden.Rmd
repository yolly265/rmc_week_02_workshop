pacman::p_load(tidyverse, knitr, here)

# Import the communicable diseases data
data_cmnn <- read_csv(here("data", "burden-of-disease-cmnn.csv"))
```

## Table of Estimates for CMNN Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here render a table for the DALY burden over time for the three countries 
# You should pivot the data to show each country in a separate column.
# Use kable() from the knitr package to render the table.
```

## Plot Showing Trends in CMNN Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.
```
